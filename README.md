Refactoring an html website 

# <span style="color:red">Horiseon Social Solutions Inc Refactor</span>

This was the first challenge assignment for our UPENN Bootcamp. We were tasked with taking the client's existing codebase and refactoring it to meet modern accessibility standards which would boost its SEO ranking. (See **User Story** and **Acceptable Criteria** sections below).

## üòñ <span style="color:red">User Story</span> 

AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è <span style="color:red">Acceptable Criteria</span> 

- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the icon and image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## üîß <span style="color:red">Optimizations</span> 

### <span style="color:blue">HTML</span>
- Replaced <div> elements with appropriate Semantic HTML elements.
- Changed colors on the page to provide a contrast that is in line with WCAG guidelines.
- Ensured heading attributes are in sequential order.
- Removed extra and unnecessary classes and ids

### <span style="color:blue">CSS</span>
- removed redundant styling.
- Removed unnecessary selectors.

### <span style="color:red">Additional</span>
